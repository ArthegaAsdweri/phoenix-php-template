<v-container class="py-5 mainContent">
    <div class="textWidth">
        <h1 class="my-5">Welcome to <span>the other page</span></h1>
        <p>
            Hey. This is the other page you find in the navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you might see in the project directory it should call the <span class="ci-orange">SomeAction</span>-Action.
            But since there is no action like that the framework will call the <span class="ci-orange">DefaultAction</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is no DefaultAction either the framework will automatically call the 404-page.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page also includes a different css file that adds 100vh height to the container element wrapping the
            content.
        </p>
    </div>
